# 🧠 CS446 Machine Learning Portfolio — Akshay Banda

Welcome!  
This repository collects a selection of my work from **CS 446: Machine Learning**, organized and refactored for clarity, reproducibility, and presentation.  
Each homework showcases different foundational ML concepts implemented from scratch and in PyTorch, reflecting both mathematical understanding and engineering best practices.
